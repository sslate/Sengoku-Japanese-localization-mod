Despite this, the new Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, later appointed Shigeuji as his deputy in the Kanto region. Not trusting him entirely, Yoshimasa had his ally Uesugi Noritada keep an eye on Shigeuji. When Uesugi, who had played a part in Mochiuji's death, was murdered by Shigeuji in 1454, the Kanto region fell into chaos as the Uesugi clan attacked in revenge. Yoshimasa sent his younger brother Masatomo to help restore order, but, unable to resolve the situation quickly, he had to settle down in Izu Province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The conflict which would eventually be known as the Onin War started in late May when fighting broke out in the capital. The two sides, now backed by a number of other clans, would continue to clash for years and the war would eventually draw in most of the warrior clans in Japan and plunge the country into 'The Warring States Period' - the Sengoku jidai.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
